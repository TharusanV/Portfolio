        <h3>What made you interested in technology?</h3>
        <p>Growing up I was facinated by futuristic media (e.g. Matrix, Blade Runner) which led me down the path of wanting to persue tech career.
          This then lead me to take up computer science in my GCSE's and continuing it through my A-Levels and my degree.<br/>
          Now I am looking to continue my development by getting real-world experience. Working on projects that aim to help others and propel the industry forward. <br/>
          <br/>
